# Brain MRI Super-Resolution Network
The model implemented is able to reconstructs a high-resolution version of an image from a low-resolution (factor of 4) version given. The basic structure was inspired by ESPCN (Efficient Sub-Pixel CNN) proposed by Shi, 2016 and Keras implementation by Long, 2020.

The model was also embedded with Residual Dense Blocks, inspired by Chakraborty, 2021. Residual blocks prevented early saturation or degradation with accuracy from increasing number of layers.
